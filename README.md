1. **Purpose**

This app's main goal is to make learning enjoyable and engaging for pupils. The way it operates is as follows: when pupils input their age, the app compares it to the historical figure's passing age. That comparison reveals an interesting detail about that historical person. It's similar to having a quick history lesson at your fingers! It is an excellent method for pupils to go into the past and form genuine personal connections with these historical personalities. Furthermore, it is important to comprehend and value the people who are behind the data rather than only remembering them. That is what really excites me about learning.

1. **Design considerations**

_Intuitive design_

My design is aimed to be as simplistic as possible, allowing for a more diverse range of students to access the app with ease and allowing them to use the app effectively with encountering minimal issues, this also gives the apps design and look a very subtle and neat look to it, while still being effective. My app has no difficult fonts to read and try and understand nor does it have any images that will obstruct the interface of the application. The application layout is neatly done in a simplistic manner to ensure complete understanding by the user.

_Content prioritization_

In my app the interface elements include an EditText where the user has to enter an age desired and then get a result as an output being information displayed in the textView based on an historical figure that matches with the age entered to the age that the historical figure had passed away, it will give the user information and a fact about the historical figure. Also, two buttons below one another, the first button being the generate button, once the desired age has been entered in the EditText this button must be clicked to generate an output. The following button is a clear button, once an age has been entered and generated it must be cleared, this button does that, afterwards the next age value can be entered. There is a TextView that will display the output text once the age has been entered and generated, this text box has no borders to give a more modern look to the application and possibly add to the simplicity in the applications interface, and thereafter it will clear the next once the necessary button is clicked. I have added a pictureView, this is where I have added a picture to enhance the applications looks, it also has text to ensure the user understands what the purpose of the application is and what output they must expect from the app. The application is legible for people of all ages, for it explains and corrects the user if any errors are made, such as, if the incorrect age is entered and the generate button is clicked then the app will prompt the user to “please enter age between 20 and 100”, a valid answer will be given once the prompt is followed correctly. If there is no age entered and the generate button is clicked, it will prompt the user to “enter valid age.” Once the prompt is followed and an age is entered, the next outcome displayed will be different.  

_Legible text content_

The choice of font is fundamental in making sure that there is an optimal user experience within the app interface. By selecting a clear and easily readable font, the usability of the app is made much easier for users. The font size was chosen to ensure that it is large enough for users to comfortably read and interpret the text displayed. The attention to detail in design shows that the app was designed with user friendliness being taken into consideration.

_Make interface elements clearly visible_

I put a lot of effort into designing my app's layout and appearance. Everything works smoothly and makes sense to the user, that was my aim. I therefore made sure to give everything in the interface plenty of room and to arrange it logically. In this way, when a user launches the program, all the content feels natural and is easily accessible. It makes using the application enjoyable when it is intuitive. It is as though everything effortlessly falls into place, you do not have to work to figure out where things are or what to do next. The primary objective is to make things as simple as possible for the user and my app does this well, the user can navigate with ease.

_Hand position controls_

The buttons in the interface are arranged effectively, they are put in the center of the screen, prominently and clearly, which not only improves visibility but also guarantees user accessibility and usefulness. Additionally, the sizing is appropriate for use without accidental clicks. The hand position controls are overall done well, they will not be hard to reach for anyone and can easily be used with one hand if needed.

_Images_

I chose the ideal picture for the application. It needed to fit the theme of simplicity. Though, it must convey the main goal of the app, which is to teach children about historical personalities. I therefore selected a picture that supported the app's instructional objective in addition to being visually appealing. I think that when an app integrates everything in this way, consumers have a better overall experience. Additionally, a clear image from the outset makes it easier for users to comprehend the purpose of the program and makes it easier for them to explore without becoming lost.

_Utilizing GitHub_

GitHub serves as a resource for developers, such as myself, it is a digital hub where I will be submitting my software projects. It is an online platform designed for coding groups and education institutions to share ideas and projects of their own. I will be using GitHub to submit my coding-based project. GitHub is also a knowledge sharing, and involvement in open-source projects, such as the projects I will be submitting. It is not only a space for coding but also a hub where developers gather to shape the future of software development and promote creativity. GitHub Actions allow you to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code directly from your GitHub repository. The actions will be utilized in my projects, will be the deployment of my code directly from my GitHub repository.

Overall, my app is well designed and serves its main purpose, which is to educate students on historical figures and make it fun for them. The application meets all requirements and is easy to understand. The app is appropriate to the target users that will be using it.
